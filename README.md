This is a barebones version of a job application/acceptance application made using MERN stack. It has support for both recruiters and applicants, from their registration/login to creating/applying to specific jobs. It then has functionality for accepting those applications, and all these changes are handled in the database. There is close to no frontend design, but except that, this application has all the basic functionalities that can be expected of such an application.
